user types - admin, shopowner, shopvisitor

admin can delete shopowner/shopvisitor accounts
shopowner can edit his shopowner account
shopvisitor can visit,follow shopowners' accounts 

to create a shopowner account you need a (username,password) pair given to you by the admin. for this you should certify that you are shopowner (directly, email..)

to create a shopvisitor account you should sign up using google or facebook.

since shopowner is a certified user he is given the shopvisitor account's privileges eventhough he has not signed up using google or facebook


other than that any random visitor to the website can visit shopowners' accounts but cannot follow them. 

when a shopvisitor follows shopowner accounts the updates of respective shops will be in shopvisitor's wall.
